# CLAUDE.md — idea-exploration project

This project is for **exploring** ideas, not converging on them prematurely.

It was scaffolded from the `templates/idea-exploration/` template of coltrane-oss — the diverge-discipline flavor of the seed-that-plants-seeds. The double-diamond × safe-prereg shape is wired into `standards/idea_exploration_protocol.json`.

## The discipline

When the user invokes `/coltrane-explore-idea <topic>` (or directly dispatches the `idea_exploration_protocol` standard), walk the 5 phases in order. **Do not skip ahead.**

```
DISCOVER → DEFINE_AUDIENCE → DEFINE_SEAL → DEVELOP → DELIVER
[expand]   [contract — D1]   [contract — D1 seal]   [expand — D2]   [contract — D2 seal]
```

## Rules — hold these tight

### 1. DISCOVER fully before DEFINE. Refuse to commit until ≥7 alternatives are on the table.

The reflex to "pick the best three after the first three look strong" IS the failure mode this discipline kills. Stay in DISCOVER. Generate the 7th and 8th candidate even when it feels redundant — that's where the lineage-shifts and opposite-pole reframings surface.

### 2. Every surviving idea earns its own predict / kill_condition / apoha SEAL. Without all three, the idea doesn't pass DEFINE.

`predict` must be a SPECIFIC observable outcome with a checkable threshold. "This will be useful" is REJECTED. `kill_condition` must be concrete + measurable. "People don't like it" is REJECTED. `apoha` must contain ≥1 inverted-kill ("NOT X"). An empty apoha is REJECTED.

When all three are present and well-formed, the `sha256_pre_verdict` is computed over the canonical triple and the seal FIRES. The triple is FROZEN thereafter. Appendable post-seal; not mutable.

### 3. Archived ideas are SEEDS not LOSSES.

The user picks 1-3 sealed candidates to actually DEVELOP. The rest go to `archived_seeds/<candidate_id>.json` with their seal-hash intact. These are **restartable** — a future explorer can pull an archived seed and DEVELOP it without re-sealing (the seal is already valid; the apoha-discipline already paid its cost).

This is the "seed that plants seeds" recursion at work inside the idea-exploration lane.

### 4. Audience-modeler kills ideas with no plausible receiver. Speak audience-SHAPES, not customer-segments.

"Developers" is not an archetype. "Day looks like X, wants Y, would receive this because Z" is an archetype. If you can't name 3 shapes for a candidate without contortion, the audience_modeler should recommend a kill — and that kill is honest, not a softening.

### 5. Verdict at DELIVER compares to the FROZEN seal — no post-hoc reframing.

`RIPENED` = predict met as-stated. `PARTLY-RIPENED` = a SPECIFIC sub-criterion ripened. `RIPENED-DIFFERENTLY` = the apoha proved more important than the predict (the inverted-kill drove the value). `KILL-FIRED` = observable fell short of threshold. `ABORTED` = the experiment didn't run.

Don't collapse classes. Don't slide into "mostly ripened."

## Integration with miles's universal phase-agents

When miles ships the 4 universal phase-agents (`domain-explorer`, `problem-definer`, `solution-developer`, `delivery-finalizer`) on `origin/main`, this template's 5 lane-specific agents can collapse into the universal phase-agent shape — keeping the lane-specific charters as domain tilts on the universal agents. The standard's 5-phase structure can stay as a lane-specific elaboration of the universal 4-phase shape (the two-step DEFINE captures the audience-receiver check that's specific to idea-exploration).

When cajal's `project-bootstrap-v0` standard merges on `origin/main`, this template's directory becomes the payload that DEVELOP unrolls when a user runs `coltrane dispatch project-bootstrap-v0 --use-case idea-exploration` in a fresh repo.
