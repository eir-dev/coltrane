/** THE ROOM ACTUALLY STANDS UP.
 *
 *  Every other venue law in this suite asserts on a RENDERED DOCUMENT or an EMITTED CONFIG. That is
 *  how eighty-eight green laws coexisted with a realizer that stood nothing up: `realize()` rendered
 *  a compose document for its refusal side-effects, THREW IT AWAY, returned PLAYING, and handed back
 *  an MCP config naming `coltrane-gig-<id8>-room-1` — a container nothing ever created. Every
 *  assertion about that config passed. `docker exec` into it fails with "No such file or directory",
 *  because the transport names a container that does not exist.
 *
 *  Verifying the artifact is not verifying the behaviour — the same lesson the credential-secret note
 *  in src/venue_realizer.ts records one layer down, relearned at the layer above it.
 *
 *  So this law does the only thing that can distinguish the two: it takes the config the ENGINE
 *  emitted, runs it VERBATIM as a subprocess, and requires coltrane's own MCP server to answer over
 *  it. Nothing here is hand-typed; a hand-built compose file and a hand-typed `docker exec` is what
 *  made the earlier claim look true.
 *
 *  Gated on a live daemon, and the gate is visible: without docker these SKIP, they do not pass. A
 *  law that silently succeeds where it cannot run is the hollow-green this repo refuses. */
