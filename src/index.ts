// The two engine-half modules a downstream consumer imports directly. Neither is wired into a
// surface yet — enqueueing locally and claiming locally are each their own contract — but both are
// PUBLIC surfaces, not internals: local_queue is the third queue backing (the file sibling of
// fileGenomeStore), and residency is the enforcement half of `coltrane reside`. Exporting them here
// is what tests/exported_symbols_are_reachable.test.ts asks for when a mechanism has no in-src
// caller: "wire it or export it." Wiring is a separate act; reachability is not.
