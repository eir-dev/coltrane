// RE-CLAIM WITH VERDICTS, PARK, IDEMPOTENT EFFECT, CANCEL, and PARTIAL-WRITE SAFETY.
//
// A gig that parks at a human chair must be re-claimable with its verdicts, matching the drain's
// park->approve->re-claim path (worker.ts parkGig :446, ClaimedGig.approvals :116, approvalWiring).
// The local queue has NO cloud sink — the file root IS both store and sink — so the local park must
// write role-keyed verdicts where the local re-claim reads them. And because a lapsed lease can let
// a second worker re-run a gig (at-least-once, not true exactly-once), the effect must be
// idempotent: a re-run re-seals the SAME output (content_sha dedup, worker.ts lineage) rather than
// duplicating, and a re-run that would produce a DIFFERENT output fails closed rather than forking.
