// steve_in_channel.spec.ts — TRUE end-to-end with a real Slack chime.
//
// Spawns a real `claude -p` subprocess (Steve), grants Bash so Steve can
// invoke the ant_cli wrapper, and asks Steve to post a unique marker to
// the band Slack channel. Then verifies the chime landed via slack history
// (also via ant_cli).
//
// Two boundary crossings tested live, NOT mocked:
//   1. Claude Code spawn → real LLM completion
//   2. ant_cli → real Slack POST → message visible in channel history
//
// What "PASS" means here: Steve was spawned, ran the command, and the
// marker is recoverable from Slack. If Steve refuses the tool, or the
// post fails, or the marker doesn't appear in history → FAIL with the
// reason in the assertion message.
